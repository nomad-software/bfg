# bfg
**A fast Brainfuck interpreter and compiler written in the Go programming language.**

---

## Overview

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism. The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. It is designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use. It was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. [See wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)

### Usage

Brainfuck programs can be specified by specifing the `-f` switch.

```
bfg -f program.bf
```
